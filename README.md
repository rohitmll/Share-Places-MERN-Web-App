# Share-Places-MERN-Web-App

Share-Places is a social media app that allows you to add pictures of places you've visited and share them with the world. It was created using Mongo db, Express, React, and Node, and CSS. You have the ability to signup/signin, create places with a short write up, add pictures, link location to a pop-up google map, and edit and delete places.
